#**Aleida**

## **Introduction**
_Aleida is an application which would detect botnet traffic in a private organisation network without reading network traffic but only analysing network behaviour._

In today’s world, Botnet has become one of the greatest threats to network security. Even though detection technology has been much improved and some solutions to Internet security have been proposed and improved, the threat still exists. This project provide  a mechanism for Botnet detection by analysing Network ﬂow behaviour. This proposed approach is easy to implement and can be further used and extended in the campus dormitory network, home networks, and the mobile 3G network.
